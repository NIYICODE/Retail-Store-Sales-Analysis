### Sales Analysis using Excel
As the Data Analyst, I was instructed by the Sales Director of DTLM Retail, a fictitious store to analyze the sales data. He wants to keep tab on the store's performance in all ramifications.

The store, DTLM Retail, is much into the business of sales of various products to consumers nationwide and other countries.


### Datasets Overview
The dataset consist of;

The Sales table: This contains the order number, sales data, sales channel, currency, salesteamindex, storeindex, productindex, order qty, unit price, unit cost, revenue, profit

Products: This contains index, Product Name and Category

Store Locations: This contains name, county, state code, state, longitude, latitude, area code, population, households, median income, land area, water area, time zone

Sales team: This conatins index number, sales team, region.


### To gather insights on the stores performance, I was directed to provide answers to the following questions;

1. What is the revenue and profit for every order?

2. What are the two top revenue produdcts in January?

3. Which sales team made most revenue from Decoratives in March?

4. Identify which metric(s) correlates with revenue per state?


### The following are processes I used, in a bid to provide answer to the business questions:

Cleaned the data using power query and merging necessary tables to overcome ambiguity.

Created relationships; data modeling between the tables

Created reports using Pivot table and visualized my reports via charts

Designed my dashboard with the reports and most important metrics.
